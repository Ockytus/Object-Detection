Object Detection using yolo AI model. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a prominent CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model for object detection, recognition, and classification. YOLO was created by combining convolutional layers with connected layers. After the AI has learned to dectect object, we embedded into a microchip with built in camera to see the object and which object appears - the light will light up in real time.
